Installing Blacktie into JBoss AS

   1 Download 5.1.0.GA and configure JBoss AS to use JTS:
   	- Extract into any location on your hard drive, this will be referred to as JBOSS_HOME;
   	- cd JBOSS_HOME/docs/examples/transactions;
   	- Type: ant jts (this installs the JTS version of JBoss Transactions);
   	- Edit JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/conf/jbossts-properties.xml to change the CONFIGURATION_FILE to NAME_SERVICE
      (this cause JBossTS to make its TransactionFactory available as a CORBA object);
   2. Download HornetQ 2.1.2.Final and configure JBoss AS to use it:
    - Extract into any location on your harddrive we will call this HQ_HOME
    - cd HQ_HOME/config/jboss-as-5/
    - chmod 775 build.sh
    - Ensure JBOSS_HOME is set and run ./build.sh
    - Add the blacktie administration security configuration to 
          JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy/hornetq.sar/hornetq-configuration.xml
      <security-setting match="jms.queue.BTR_BTDomainAdmin">
         <permission type="send" roles="blacktie,guest"/>
         <permission type="consume" roles="blacktie,guest"/>
      </security-setting>
      <security-setting match="jms.queue.BTR_BTStompAdmin">
         <permission type="send" roles="blacktie,guest"/>
         <permission type="consume" roles="blacktie,guest"/>
      </security-setting>
   3. Edit $BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh|bat:
      - make sure BLACKTIE_HOME is set to the BlackTie install location;
      - make sure JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR is set to the interface on which the application server is running (see step 6 below);
   4. Copy $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/blacktie-admin-services-ear-[VERSION].ear to JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy
   5. Copy $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/btconfig.xml to JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/conf
   6. Copy $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/blacktie-rhq-plugin-[VERSION].jar to JBOSS_HOME/server/all-with-hornetq/deploy/admin-console.war/plugins
   7. Start the all configuration of the application server:
      cd JBOSS_HOME; bin/run.sh -c all-with-hornetq -b $JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR

Running the Examples

   1. cd $BLACKTIE_HOME
   2. Make sure the setenv.[sh|bat] script has been sourced
   3. To run all the examples execute the samples script run_all_samples.[sh|bat]

examples/xatmi/txfooapp
    Demonstrates updating multiple databases within a single transaction. To run the example follow the README.

examples/xatmi/fooapp
    Starts a simple echo server and runs two clients (written in Java and C)

examples/admin/jmx
    Starts a simple server and then stops the server using the JMX interface to the BlackTie mbean component

examples/admin/xatmi
    Starts a simple server and then stops the server by sending XATMI requests to the Administration service

examples/security
    Shows how services may be secured using the <security> element in the BlackTie configuration file (btconfig.xml)
    Refer to the README file in the examples/security directory for more information

examples/mdb
    Demonstrates how to write BlackTie services as MDB's: starts a service (implemented as an MDB) running in the 
    App Server. Then runs a client which uses the JAB api to send requests to the service. The example also shows 
    the service making EJB calls to demonstrate transaction propagation.

integration1
    Shows how a C client can invoke an EJB (via a "BlackTie service adaptor") within the scope of a transaction
    started at the client.
