If you are running the test from a binary distribution you will need to ensure that 
the JAtmiBroker XATMI library is installed in your .m2 Maven folder:
cd BLACKTIE_HOME/jatmibroker-xatmi
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -DartifactId=jatmibroker-xatmi -Dversion=2.0-MR1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=jatmibroker-xatmi-2.0.jar
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -DartifactId=blacktie-xsd -Dversion=2.0-MR1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=blacktie-xsd-2.0.jar
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -DartifactId=atmibroker-idl -Dversion=2.0-MR1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=atmibroker-idl-java-2.0-MR2.jar

After the dependencies are installed you can then run the example using the following command:
	mvn install
