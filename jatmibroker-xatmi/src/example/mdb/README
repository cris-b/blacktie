NOTE: If you are using IPv6 you will need to change any references to localhost in the btconfig.xml
config files to be localhost4 or 127.0.0.1

1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
variables BLACKTIE_HOME and JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR appropriately.
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

2. RUN JBOSS WITH JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SET
export JBOSSAS_IP_ADDR=localhost
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/run.[sh|bat] -c all-with-hornetq
NOTE: Make sure you have stompconnectservice and blacktie-admin-services installed

3. RUN THE EXAMPLE
This example makes use of maven to build, deploy and test an XATMI service deployed 
as an MDB.

Type:
	mvn package jboss:redeploy -DskipTests
	mvn surefire:test
You need to do these in two seperate stages due to a bug in HornetQ which means that
the call to deploy will return before the queues are created.

After this bug was fixed you would be able to call:
	mvn install
But you will need to uncomment the call to skip in the pom.xml
