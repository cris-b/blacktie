1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
appropriately. You will need to make sure that you edit the variables with values 
starting with REPLACE_WITH_: 
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_BIN_DIR/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_BIN_DIR%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

2. RUN THE EXAMPLE
This example makes use of maven to build, deploy and test an XATMI service deployed 
as an MDB.
You must ensure that BLACKTIE_CONFIGURATION_DIR is either not set or set to the 
empty string before running the test.

If you are running the test from a binary distribution you will need to ensure that 
the JAtmiBroker XATMI library is installed in your .m2 Maven folder:
cd BLACKTIE_BIN_DIR/jatmibroker-xatmi
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -DartifactId=jatmibroker-xatmi -Dversion=1.0-MR5-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=jatmibroker-xatmi-1.0-MR5-SNAPSHOT.jar -DgeneratePom=true
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -DartifactId=atmibroker-idl -Dversion=1.0-MR5-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=atmibroker-idl-1.0-MR5-SNAPSHOT.jar -DgeneratePom=true
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -DartifactId=blacktie-xsd -Dversion=1.0-MR5-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=blacktie-xsd-1.0-MR5-SNAPSHOT.jar -DgeneratePom=true

After the dependencies are installed you can then run the example using the following command:
mvn install
