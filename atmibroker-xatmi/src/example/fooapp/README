In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
appropriately. You will need to make sure that you edit the variables with values 
starting with REPLACE_WITH_: 
On Linux you need to edit:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

2. CREATE THE SERVER
On Linux:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/bin/generate_server.sh -Dservice.names=BAR -Dserver.includes=BarService.c
On Windows:
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\bin\generate_server.bat -Dservice.names=BAR -Dserver.includes=BarService.c
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not installed ant-contrib into your ANT distribution:
	BUILD FAILED
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-1.0-M4-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:160: Problem: failed to create task or type propertycopy
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not installed cpp-tasks into your ANT distribution:
	BUILD FAILED
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-1.0-M4-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:113: The following error occurred while executing this line:
	/home/tom/blacktie/dist/blacktie-1.0-M4-SNAPSHOT/bin/generate-executables.xml:140: Problem: failed to create task or type cc

3. CREATE THE CLIENT
On Linux:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/bin/generate_client.sh -Dclient.includes=client.c
On Windows:
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\bin\generate_client.bat -Dclient.includes=client.c

4. RUN THE APPLICATIONS
Make sure that the naming and transaction services are running, if not, run the JBoss server:
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/run.sh|bat -c blacktie
4.1 RUN THE SERVER
./server -c <win32|linux>
4.2 RUN THE CLIENT
You will need to set the environment variable ATMIBROKER_CONFIGURATION_DIR to either win32 or linux prior to running the client
./client
NOTE: If you get the following error you have not sourced setenv.sh|bat
./client: error while loading shared libraries: libTAO_CosNaming.so.1.6.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directoryI
NOTE: If you get the following error it means you did not set ATMIBROKER_CONFIGURATION_DIR to the correct folder:
[tom@localhost fooapp]$ ./client
