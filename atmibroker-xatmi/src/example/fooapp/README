ant -f $ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/bin/generate-executables.xml server -Dservice.names=BAR -Dserver.includes=BarService.c -Dconfiguration.type=debug -Dbasedir=. -Dtoolchain.compiler=<msvc|gcc>

3. CREATE THE CLIENT
ant -f $ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/bin/generate-executables.xml client -Dclient.includes=client.c -Dconfiguration.type=debug -Dbasedir=. -Dtoolchain.compiler=<msvc|gcc>

4. RUN THE APPLICATIONS
