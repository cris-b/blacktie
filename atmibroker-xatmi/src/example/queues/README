1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
appropriately. You will need to make sure that you edit the variables with values 
starting with REPLACE_WITH_: 
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

On Windows: 
You MUST use an environment configured with the VC++ development tools, e.g. launch:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat


2. CREATE THE CLIENT
	generate_client -Dclient.includes=queues.c


3. DEPLOY THE BLACKTIE ADMIN SERVICE
Undeploy any older versions of the blacktie admin service
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/blacktie-admin-services-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all/deploy
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/btconfig.xml into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all/conf


5. RUN THE APPLICATION SERVER
Make sure that the naming, messaging and transaction services are running, by running the JBoss server:
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/run.sh|bat -c all


6 RUN THE APPLICATION

export BLACKTIE_SERVER_ID=1	# automatically starts a server running when tpadvertise is called
./client

If you want to use priorities then try running the example with args of the form <put cnt msgid priority>
./client put 2 0 9	# queue 2 messages at highest priority (9) starting with message id 0
./client put 2 2 8	# queue 2 messages at next lower priority (8) starting with message id 2
./client put 2 4 7	# queue 2 messages at next lower priority (7) starting with message id 4
./client get 6		# retrieve all 6 messages - they should be received in increasing message id order
