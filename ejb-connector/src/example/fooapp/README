1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
appropriately. You will need to make sure that you edit the variables with values 
starting with REPLACE_WITH_: 
On Linux you need to edit:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

2. MVN INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES
NOTE: If you are building from source and therefore have the following dependencies 
in your .m2 cache, you can ignore this step:
cd $ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/connectors/ejb
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=ejb-connector-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dpackaging=jar 
   -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DartifactId=ejb-connector
cd $ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/connectors/jab
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=atmibroker-idl-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dpackaging=jar 
   -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DartifactId=atmibroker-idl
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jatmibroker-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dpackaging=jar 
   -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DartifactId=jatmibroker-core 

3. COMPILE THE EXAMPLE EJB CONNECTOR APPLICATION
In a well configured environment, type the following:
cd ejb-connector-example
mvn install -DskipTests
cd ..
cd ejb-connector-example-ear
mvn install

4. DEPLOY THE EXAMPLE EJB CONNECTOR EAR
While the application server is stopped:
cd ejb-connector-example-ear
cp target/ejb-connector-example-ear-1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear <JBOSS_HOME>/server/<configuration>/deploy/

5. RUN THE REQUIRED SERVICES
Make sure that the naming and transaction services are running, if not, run the script under
Linux:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/bin/services-scripts/start_all.sh
Windows: 
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\bin\services-scripts\start_all.bat

6. RUN THE JBOSS SERVER
cd into the <JBOSS_HOME>/bin folder
run -c <configuration>

7. RUN THE EJB CONNECTOR TEST CASES
cd ejb-connector-example
mvn test
