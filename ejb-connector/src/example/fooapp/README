1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
appropriately. You will need to make sure that you edit the variables with values 
starting with REPLACE_WITH_: 
On Linux you need to edit:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

2. COMPILE THE EXAMPLE EJB CONNECTOR APPLICATION
In a well configured environment, type the following:
cd ejb-connector-example
mvn install
cd ..
cd ejb-connector-example-ear
mvn install

2. DEPLOY THE EXAMPLE EJB CONNECTOR EAR
While the application server is stopped:
cd ejb-connector-example-ear
cp target/ejb-connector-example-ear-1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear <JBOSS_HOME>/server/<configuration>/deploy/

3. RUN THE REQUIRED SERVICES
Make sure that the naming and transaction services are running, if not, run the script under
Linux:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/bin/services-scripts/start_all.sh
Windows: 
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\bin\services-scripts\start_all.bat

2. RUN THE JBOSS SERVER
cd into the <JBOSS_HOME>/bin folder
run -c <configuration>

4. RUN THE EJB CONNECTOR TEST CASES
The simplest way to do this is to run the BarServiceTestCase under ejb-connector-example/src/test/java
The testConnectorCall and testEJBCall should work when the application server is running
