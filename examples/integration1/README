0. OVERVIEW
This example shows how a C client can invoke an EJB within the scope of the same transaction.

1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
appropriately. You will need to make sure that you edit the variables with values 
starting with REPLACE_WITH_: 
On Linux you need to edit:
	$BLACKTIE_HOME/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%BLACKTIE_HOME%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

On Windows: 
You MUST use an environment configured with the VC++ development tools, e.g. launch:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat

2. DEPLOY THE BLACKTIE ADMIN SERVICE
Undeploy any older versions of the blacktie admin service
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/blacktie-admin-services-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all/deploy
Copy the file $BLACKTIE_HOME/blacktie-admin-services/btconfig.xml into $JBOSS_HOME/server/all/conf

3. RUN THE APPLICATION SERVER
Make sure that the naming, messaging and transaction services are running, by running the JBoss server:
<JBOSS_HOME>/bin/run.sh|bat -c all

4. DEPLOY THE EJB
cd ejb
mvn install
cp target/integration1-ejb-<VERSION>.jar <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all/deploy

5. DEPLOY THE XATMI ADAPTER
cd xatmi_adapter
mvn install
cd ear
mvn install
cp target/integration1-xatmi_adapter-ear-<VERSION>.ear <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all/deploy

6. BUILD AND RUN THE CLIENT
Once the XATMI service and EJB are deployed fully into the application server, you can build the client@
generate_client -Dclient.includes=client.c
./client
