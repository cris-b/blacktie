NOTE: You may like to create a backup of this folder before starting!

NOTE: You should be using the -c all configuration of JBoss for this example to work
      Edit <JBOSS_HOME>/server/all/conf/jbossjts-properties.xml 
	to change the word CONFIGURATION_FILE to NAME_SERVICE

1. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
In order to run the example you need to make sure that you have set the environment
appropriately. You will need to make sure that you edit the variables with values 
starting with REPLACE_WITH_: 
On Linux you need to edit:
	$ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/setenv.sh
On Windows:
	%ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR%\setenv.bat
Then, execute the script setenv

2. MVN INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES
NOTE: If you are building from source and therefore have the following dependencies 
in your .m2 cache, you can ignore this step:
cd $ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/connectors/ejb
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=ejb-connector-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dpackaging=jar 
   -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DartifactId=ejb-connector
cd $ATMIBROKER_BIN_DIR/connectors/jab
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=atmibroker-idl-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dpackaging=jar 
   -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DartifactId=atmibroker-idl
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jatmibroker-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dpackaging=jar 
   -DgroupId=org.jboss.blacktie -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DartifactId=jatmibroker-core 

4. RUN THE JBOSS SERVER
cd into the <JBOSS_HOME>/bin folder
run -c all

4. COMPILE, DEPLOY AND TEST THE EXAMPLE EJB CONNECTOR APPLICATION
In a well configured environment, type the following:
cd ejb-connector-example
mvn install -DskipTests
cd ..
cd ejb-connector-example-ear
mvn install

NOTE: You will need temporarily need to restart the JBoss Application Server before you
